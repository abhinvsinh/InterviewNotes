Requirements
- newsfeed
- nestted comments
- users can quickly see who they are following and who follows them
- we can quickly load all posts of a given user
- low latency news feed from posts that a user follows
- posts can have configurable privacy types , as do folloers
- users can comment on posts and comments can be infinitely nested

Reads >> writes

Capacity estimates
- 100 chars a post, 100 bytes for text , maybe 100 for other metadata
- 1 billion posts per day-> 1 billion 200 bytes 365 days/year= 73 tb /year
- on average users have 100 followers, some verified users have millions
- comments also have 100 characters, so around 200 bytes with metadata
- most commetns on one post = 1 million 

Fetching Followers /following
- get Followers(userId)
- get Following(userid)  we want these queries to return quickly
user -> follower service
follower/follwoing DB
user -> 
follower following partition
- user id -> partitionkey
- use flink to keep state of all the followerte for a gien poster, avoids making calls to db

stream followers changes to flink bia cdc
- shard flinkg on poster id
- posts, edits, security permission changes through this path


-- posts , DB schema
- cassandra, partiitoin useing userid, timestamp as sort key, tweetbody
