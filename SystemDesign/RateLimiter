REquirement
   build a rate liniter that stps maliciious users from submitting roo many requests to our services while inroducing minmal latency
  Support  a variety of different rate limitng techniques
capacity estimates
  1 billion users
  20 services to rate limit
  user id = 8 bytes, integer to keep track of count = 4 bytes
  1 billion * 20 * (8+4) = 240 GB

what to rate limit on
  userid
    ++easy to trak, bad users will be blocked
    -- users can create many accounts , not all services need authentication

  ip address
      ++ easy to track, no need to be signed on , precents multiple accounts
      -- ggod actors on same network will be throttled

  Hybrid appoach


Rate limiting interace
we will be able to support different umplememntation of the rate limitedr interface

  boolean ratelimit(long userid, string ipaddress, string servicename, date request+time)
  returns true if rewuest should be rate limited

where does the rate liiiter go

note: the amount of data that we need to store is too bif to put on lur load balancer
option1 - perform rate limiting locally on each service
option 2 dedicated distributed rate limiter

local rate 
  pros
